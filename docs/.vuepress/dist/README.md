# 2021 Commercial Fleet & MRO Forecast

## Overview

There are a number of enhancements / improvements within the 2021 Commercial forecast (vs last year’s version of the forecast.) This includes taking into account the grounding of the Boeing MAX aircraft, as well as the impact on the market due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.

### New Forecast Scope

- All turbofan and turboprop, Western-built aircraft originally/primarily designed for the commercial scheduled airline market:

  - Includes aircraft operated in scheduled airline service, executive-configured aircraft not in scheduled service (e.g. 737-800 with executive interior, but not manufactured with BBJ configuration), cargo/freight operations, and commercial types in civil-government service
  - Inclusive of +19-seat certified capacity aircraft and higher, pax and freighters
  - Inclusive of on non-Western built types with Western-built engines, e.g. SSJ, MRJ (SpaceJet), C919, etc.
  - **Excludes** commercial types operated in military service

### Boeing 737 MAX impact:

- Approximately 500 grounded, undelivered aircraft

- Note the large spike in deliveries in year 2021 – this is the combined effect of MAXs being delivered and aircraft returning form long-term storage

### COVID 19 impact:

- Fewer aircraft in service (the 2020 forecast year begins with the same in-service fleet size as year-end 2015)
- Storage activity, approximately 5,500 aircraft entered long-term storage since Feb/March of 2020. This forecast accounts for this activity and outlines a plan to return a bit over half of these aircraft to the fleet over the next ~ 3-years

  - The impact is that aircraft which are “stored” don’t accrue any MRO demand, but upon return to service, they are required to have all engine and airframe services completed before being certified for revenue service.
  - Aircraft that are parked do accrue MRO demand by calendar, BUT don’t accrue much utilization. So calendar-based events are triggered, but utilization based events are diminished. We’ve accounted for these variables with our utilization/flight data.

### MRO Reporting & Data

> Behind the scenes we’ve built-into the source data aircraft age and associated it to MRO demand per aircraft age cohorts which means we have greater ability to create customize MRO reports for those customers asking

- Reporting revisions various, i.e. engine MRO demand>Engine MRO Events reflects both aircraft and engines

- Engine overhaul intervals and overhaul costs revised

- Turboprops now use the exact same modeling and reporting as jets. You will find the differences mainly in the **MRO Demand** tab and the **MRO Events** tab (one filter button, Propulsion Type” can be used to differentiate between the 2 engine types)

- Type Certificate Holder has been added as a new filter on most tabs
- Reports have been added, modified (verticle axis, etc.) to improve readability and meet customer requests

- IFE(C) system assumptions have been completely revised. New ATA Chapter codes spell out more specifically

#### _New_ Historical Fleet Tab

- A new historical fleet metrics tab provides a limited, summary view of fleet counts at year end 2015-2020.

  - Deliveries
  - Retirement
  - In-Service Fleet
    Note: that neither the values nor filters within this tab are connected to other tabs, reports or metrics; this is standalone and provides historical context.
    Note: year 2020 data is forecast/projected

#### MRO Expense Type taxonomy -major re-write:

- Now includes description - i.e.; ATA 21 Air Conditioning & Pressurization

- Taxonomy is now close 99% mapped exactly to The MRO Prospector
- Two new ATA chapter codes were spelled out under modifications:
  - ATA 44 IFE
  - ATA 25 Interior Equip & Furnishings

#### Engine MRO modeling changed

- Engine MRO is now broken into two major expense types (**no one else offers this detail.**)

  1. Engine Shop visits/overhauls/performance restorations.

     - This is the traditional engine MRO category, but the cost figures now **_only include_** the overhaul costs, the Life Limited Parts (LLPs) are excluded and accounted for in a separate expense type, Engine LLPs

     - Traditional overhauls are displayed under "ATA 72 Engine Shop Visits"

  2. Engine LLPs. LLPs are now accounted for under a separate expense type:

     - Turbofans (jets) = “ATA 72 Engine LLP”
     - Turboprops (props) = “ATA 72T Engine LLP”
     - See the new filters available and the new events on the MRO events tab, Engine LLPs

> Note: In real life practice, both events are sometimes completed at the same time “off wing”. But, the two services are so expense that it makes economic sense at times to complete during two different shop visits as shown in the forecast event counts.
